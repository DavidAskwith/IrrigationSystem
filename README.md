# Irrigation System

A plant tracking and automation system. Used to view plant progress, store data on the grow environment and automate watering.
The app will integrate with a microcontroller hosting a small server to retrieve sensor data.

## Motivation

I wanted to improve my gardening with a more data driven aproach and have a way to share my progress.

## Technology

  * Vue.js
  * ASP.NET Core
